# Volcanoes

## Project
The Yellow and Green cabs operate in and around New York City (NYC), providing people with mobility throughout the city. The demand for cabs across NYC is non-uniform, meaning certain parts of the city require more cabs. However, it is difficult to know the number of cabs required at each part of the city. This is an issue for both the cab companies and customers as the incorrect number of cabs at a location can result in the cab service being unavailable to the customer and, therefore, leading to a loss in revenue for the company. We aim to optimise the distribution of cabs across NYC by identifying areas with a high in and out flow of people in a cab. Areas with a high outflow are called volcanoes and require more cabs as a large number of people are leaving the area. While, black hole areas experience a high inflow of people and require less cabs as people are travelling to the area. We will use a existing framework that identifies volcanoes and black holes and apply it to the car services scenario in NYC.

## Progress
Currently, we have gathered the dataset and pre-processed it to remove unnecessary columns and rows that contain invalid data. Additionally, we have established a method for visualising the data, by marking the volcanoes and black holes on the grid, which is overlaid on a map of NYC.

## Future Work
Future work for the project includes adding additional data to the NYC map to identify potential causes for the volcanoes and black holes. For example, including data about bus breakdowns and delays.
